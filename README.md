# Subset Generation in C

This C program generates all possible subsets of a given set of integers. It uses bitwise operations to efficiently generate subsets and dynamically allocates memory to store the subsets.

## How it Works

1. The `subsets` function takes three arguments:
   - `nums`: An array of integers representing the input set.
   - `numsSize`: The number of elements in the `nums` array.
   - `returnSize`: A pointer to an integer that will store the number of subsets generated.
   - `returnColumnSizes`: A pointer to an array that will store the size of each subset.

2. The function calculates the total number of subsets (`2^numsSize`) and dynamically allocates memory for two arrays:
   - `rv`: An array of pointers, where each pointer will point to a subset.
   - `returnColumnSizes`: An array that will store the size of each subset.

3. For each subset:
   - It calculates the number of elements in the subset by counting the number of set bits in the binary representation of the subset index (`i`). This is done using the `__builtin_popcount` function. (You can use the alternative function instead of using __builtin_popcount mentioned in the main.c)
   - It dynamically allocates memory for the subset based on its size.
   - It iterates over each element in the input set and includes the element in the subset if its corresponding bit in `i` is set.

4. Finally, the function returns the array `rv`, which contains all the subsets, and updates the `returnSize` and `returnColumnSizes` variables.

## Usage

1. Include the `subsets` function implementation in your C program.
2. Call the `subsets` function with the input set and retrieve the generated subsets.
3. Iterate over the subsets and process them as needed.

```c
int** subsets(int* nums, int numsSize, int* returnSize, int** returnColumnSizes);

int main() {
    // Example usage
    int nums[] = {1, 2, 3};
    int numsSize = sizeof(nums) / sizeof(nums[0]);

    int returnSize;
    int* returnColumnSizes;

    int** result = subsets(nums, numsSize, &returnSize, &returnColumnSizes);

    // Process the subsets...

    return 0;
}
```
